The VLOOKUP function is a life saver. It searches down the first column of a range for the key you want to find and returns the value of a specified cell in the row found. It does sound a bit opaque but by having a look at a specific example it will come all clear. Or at least that is the hope :).
Let's have a look at the formula first.

### Quick example:

Let's imagine we have a list of clients, defined by their Cust ids, and the corresponding amount they spent. Let's imagine we want to retrieve the amount that a specific customer (Cust ID = 3) spent. In this case this is a trivial task as we have just a few rows of data, but you can imagine how _VLOOKUP_ becomes powerfull when dealing with 100's or even 1000's of rows. Anyway, below is the formula:

### Now in details:

The _VLOOKUP_ function takes four parameters as input: search_key, range, index and is_sorted.

```
=vlookup(3, A1:B6, 2, 0)
```

The search_key represents the value to search for. In our example it would be the Cust ID of 3.

![png]({{ 'assets/img/googlesheets/img-vlookup/search_key.png' | relative_url }})

Range defines the range to consider for the search and the value to be returned. The first column is always and by default the column used by _VLOOKUP_ to find the search_key.

![png]({{ 'assets/img/googlesheets/img-vlookup/range.png' | relative_url }})

Index defines the number of the column where the value to be returned is located. In our case we want to know the revenue generated by Cust ID = 3, so we want to return the value in the second column of the range.

![png]({{ 'assets/img/googlesheets/img-vlookup/index.png' | relative_url }})

Is_sorted indicates whether the column to be searched is ordered or not. The value is usually FALSE (or 0) in most cases.
