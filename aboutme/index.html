				<h1>About Me</h1>				
				<img src= "{{'/assets/img/about-me/ganache.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Sylvain at work">
				<p>My name is Sylvain and I am a French Data Analyst with around 10 years of experience.</p>
				<p>I have been working accross a wide range of industries (Banking, Insurance, Software) as well as undertaking a nice variety of tasks and roles: Data Quality, Analytics, BI, Product Insights and Marketing Analytics.</p>
				<p>This website is a place where I gather all the Python, R and GoogleSheets tricks that I have learned over the years and find very valuable. I tend to use these snippets of code very often and this website is an opportunity to make them available to all interested!</p>
				<p>But there is more. You will find here tools I have built myself: from dealing with surveys or calculating statistical significance for an AB test. There are all sorts of interesting and readily available resources for Data Analyts and Marketers alike.</p>
